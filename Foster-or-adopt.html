      <h1>Fostering or Adopting an Animal</h1><br>
      <h3> Background</h3>
      <p>PACC currently houses over 500 dogs, cats, and small animals that need homes. These animals have found their way to this animal shelter from no fault of their own, but through irresponsible breeding, irresponsible pet ownership, to families unable to care for their animal anymore. PACC has dedicated their time and efforts to creating a space where the community can come in and find their newest addition. These families can choose to foster or adopt one (or more) animals to help reduce the population at PACC and to find these animals a loving home. </p>
      <h3>Benefits of Fostering </h3>
      <p>Although fostering an animal can be as short as a week, there are families who take on foster duties for multiple months to years! One issue that many families have is not having the funds to take care of their animal, but PACC will provide ALL essential needs to foster parents for free. Food, beds, kennels, toys, and medication is given to foster families when requested. All fosters have to do is provide a home away from the shelter for these animals prior to them being adopted. </p>
      <p>Fostering can also help the animals as time away from the shelter can provide notes on the animal profile. Animals who have been taken into the shelter as strays may not have notes on if they are housebroken, crate trained, friendly to small kids and/or other animals. By having foster families take them into their own home, they can see what areas these animals excel in and where they need more help. </p>
      <h3>Benefits of Adopting</h3>
      <p>Adopting an animal from PACC is such a rewarding experience because you are saving their lives! These animals could possibly be euthanized depending on space in the shelter and their behavior while at PACC. Adopters will know they are helping the community by providing a home and taking the animal away from the busy and overcrowded shelter.</p>
